Dear friends and family, and to those of you I’ve met along the way,

As you may or may not know, for the last seven months I’ve been travelling around Europe. I’ve been skiing in Austria and France, explored the German and Austrian Alps, and searched for secret hot springs in the Pyrenees Mountains. I’ve attended a graduation ceremony in Poland, I've unofficially co-authored a research paper in Germany, and hitchhiked over 20,000km to date. I’ve fallen in love, I've fallen into despair, I've contemplated life, battered by howling winds, hanging beneath the legs of a mountaintop power pylon. It’s been a quarter-life crisis of an adventure, and I’d like to share that with you.

I’m ashamed to say, I’m not exactly great at keeping up to date with you, but I think about you a lot. (Some of you, more than others.) That’s why I’ve decided to create this blog, to share with you some of my favourite stories from my travels. Some are stories of love and kindness, of the beautiful people I’ve met along the way. Others are of failure and frustration, or chaos and absurdity. Some yet are simply a documentation of the beauty of nature.

So, I hope you enjoy reading about my experiences, a taste of the bullshit adventures I call life.

Love,

Kauri
