##### Date

Hello,

I am following up regarding a compensation claim I originally lodged six months ago on approximately 31/07/2023. I have had no response yet. In one week I will be escalating through the European Commission's Dispute Resolution service, asserting my rights under Regulation (EC) 261/2004.

Flight details: Hamburg (HAM) - Reykjavik (KEF)
Flight no: EW-7808
Date: 20/07/2023 (delayed to 21/07/2023)

I have attached the relevant documentation again.
- Air Passenger Rights EU Complaint Form
- Booking confirmation
- Emails verifying delays
- Receipts verifying additional expenses due to delay totalling â‚¬46.60

Kind regards,
Kauri
