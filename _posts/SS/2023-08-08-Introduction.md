Dear friends and family, and to those of you I’ve met along the way,
As you may or may not know, for the last five months I’ve been travelling around Europe. I’ve been skiing in Austria and France, exploring the German/Austrian Alps, and spent days searching for secret hot springs in the Pyrenees Mountains.  I’ve attempted to live in the UK, attended a graduation ceremony in Poland, and (unofficially) co-authored a research paper in Germany. I’ve hitchhiked over 9,000km to date. I’ve contemplated life, battered by howling winds, hanging beneath the legs of a mountaintop power pylon. It’s been a quarter-life crisis of an adventure, and I’d like to share that with you.
I’m ashamed to say, I’m not exactly great at sharing my life. I think about you a lot. (Some of you, more than others.) That’s why I’ve decided to create this blog, to share with you some of my favourite stories from my travels. Some are stories of love and kindness, of the beautiful people I’ve met along the way. Others are of failure and frustration, or chaos and absurdity. Some yet are simply a documentation of the beauty of nature.
I hope you enjoy snf get s glimplse into my life here snf the advdenture I call life – align with blog name/cargchphrase 
Love,
Kauri
Ps: Some stories will have German translations. In fact, some stories are English translations. To you Germans, if you want a proper laugh, feel free to check out the originals.
