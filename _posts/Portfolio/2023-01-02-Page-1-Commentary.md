<!--
I've just pasted in the chat a link to my engineering portfolio, which I thought you might like to have a look at today.

*/portfolio.html is the first link I give them.
External links shouldn't work. Build _data/fake-menu.

*/portfolio-commentary.html should be shared following the interview.
Trim script to important points only; keep your full script private.
Link back to /portfolio.html, as "Link to the portfolio without additional commentary. (External links will not work.)"

P.s: Since I had an extra week, I coded my portfolio here just for you.
Naturally this document is private, and if you leave the page you may need to revisit this link in order to access it.

### Historical context
* Expert witness advice for previous building constructed on deep alluvial soils highly prone to settlement.
* Building suffered 700mm settlement including 100mm differential.
* Geotechnical modelling, assessment and reporting.
* Undertook structural design and construction for the replacement building.

### The Structure
* 113m x 20m building consisting of a 30x20m office space with a mezzanine floor, and a 87m x 23m workshop area.

* Steel-fibre-reinforced floor slab on ground beams, supported by screw piles apx 27m depth.
* Pinned steel portals with precast shear walls. Roof spans apx 24m.
* Separate design for office and workshop. Assessment of lateral load sharing, deflection comparison.
* Manipulation of interactive database to support coordination between ETABS, SAP2000 and SPACE GASS models.
* SAP2000 model for entire building footprint. Shows concrete stress analyses for ground floor slab, designed as suspended floor slab supported by ground beams on ~27m deep screw piles.
* Connection design via Hilti Profis Anchor.
