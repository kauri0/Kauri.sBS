### Historical context
* Expert witness advice for previous building constructed on deep alluvial soils highly prone to settlement.
* Building suffered 700mm settlement including 100mm differential.
* Geotechnical modelling, assessment and reporting.
* Undertook structural design and construction for the replacement building.

### The Structure
* 113m x 20m building consisting of a 30x20m office space with a mezzanine floor, and a 87m x 23m workshop area.

* Steel-fibre-reinforced floor slab on ground beams, supported by screw piles apx 27m depth.
* Pinned steel portals with precast shear walls. Roof spans apx 24m.
* Separate design for office and workshop. Assessment of lateral load sharing, deflection comparison.
* Manipulation of interactive database to support coordination between ETABS, SAP2000 and SPACE GASS models.
* SAP2000 model for entire building footprint. Shows concrete stress analyses for ground floor slab, designed as suspended floor slab supported by ground beams on ~27m deep screw piles.
* Connection design via Hilti Profis Anchor.
