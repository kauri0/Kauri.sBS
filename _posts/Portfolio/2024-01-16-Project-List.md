#### Residential Projects
##### 2022: Residential Developments, Whangarei

See [Portfolio Item 2.0: Residential Housing Development](/Residential-Housing-Development.html)<br><br>

Project: New build, offering Geotechnical and structural engineering design services. Concurrent development projects totalling 40 single and two-storey residential units. Original design fee apx $100k.<br><br>

Role: Project Management, Design Coordination and Construction Monitoring<br>

Project Management
* Tender preparation: Initial scoping and pricing
* Client negotiation and liaison
 * Negotiation of variations totalling apx 50% of original design budget
* Design meetings and liaison with external design parties

Design Coordination
* Coordination of Geotechnical reporting and assessment
 * Earthworks plans, cut/fill
* Coordination of Structural and Foundation Design
 * Existing "standard" building templates existed however these templates were limiting, and majority structures had design changes that required structural verification.
 * Repetitive work: created efficiencies through standardisation of design spreadsheets, and standard details
  * Design of internal timber framing elements outside NZS3604, including:
   * Floor and roof beams, lintels, stairs, 
  * Ribraft foundations for poor soil conditions
   * Bridging piles (for civil services)
  * Timber and concrete retaining walls up to 3.0m high

##### 2022: Residential basement excavation, Wellington
See [Portfolio Item 3.0: Concept Design & Constructability](/Concept-Design-&-Constructability.html)<br><br>
Project: Alteration: Consultation for development of basement structure beneath existing 1960â€™s residential building.
Primary contact for all parties and effective project manager.
Existing concept design for basic concrete basement walls deemed not feasible for construction.<br><br>

Project site on mountainside - extreme slopes. Soil excavation undermines the building and adjacent properties. Constructability was the main challenge; concept design revolved almost completely around constructability. Investigation into potential foundation systems, construction methodologies, consultation with piling contractors.<br><br>

Role: Project management and Concept design
* Slope stability analyses
* Scala, borehole and CPT testing across site
* Methodology:
  * Demolish front portion of structure, allowing plant access to building
  * Install secant walls within existing structure
    * Retains soil behind existing building and adjacent properties
    * ECI with piling specialist.
    * Utilise small piling rig to fit within building
  * Demolish existing flooring and install steel beams
    * Acting as both temporary propping, and permanent replacement for existing timber piles supporting structure above
  * Finally possible to excavate soil beneath building
  * Further constructability challenges regarding installation of drainage
    * Utilise weepholes and internal drainage system
    * Shotcrete to form basement walls
* Concept drawings done on Bluebeam
* Project put on hold due to financing issues after early contractor involvement. Construction was deemed too expensive. Expected to resume design in 2023.

#### Industrial Projects

Role: Foundation and Superstructure design and modelling, under guidance of senior engineer. Partial Construction Monitoring.<br>
Preliminary/Detailed design ETABS Model for office structure, including:
* Screw piles apx 27m depth with pile caps
* Ground beams, steel-fibre-reinforced floor slab
* Fixed-base steel portals, roof spans apx 24m. CFS purlins, tension cross-bracing
* Intermediary gravity columns
* Internal steel beams
* Precast shear walls
* Rib & timber infill floor with void, supported by steel beams and concrete walls
<br><br>
Drawings:
* Coordinate and inform Revit model, with structural draftsperson and external architects.
* Review drawings at each stage of issue.
* Review precast panel prefabrication drawings.
* Review steelwork prefabrication drawings.

##### 2019: Ngunguru Substation, Ngunguru, and (similar)<br>2018: Hikurangi Substation, Hikurangi
Project: New build<br><br>
Role: Structure and foundation design, Construction Monitoring<br>
Switchroom & concrete basement design<br>
Masonry and concrete walls<br>
Concrete foundation design for transformers

#### Commercial Projects
##### 2022: Mangawhai Beach School, Mangawhai
Project: 100m2 extension to the existing staff building, single storey, max 5m height.<br><br>

Role: Foundation and Superstructure design and modelling, under guidance of senior engineer.<br>
Project management & coordination:
* Project scoping, pricing, invoicing
* Primary client contact, architectural coordination

Preliminary/Detailed design in SAP2000 of extension, including:
* Bored concrete pile foundations for portal legs.
* Two-way pinned steel portal frames spanning up to 9m supporting timber rafters.
* Internal timber piles and bearers.
* Steel wind beams.
* Shallow footings, stairs and wing walls.

##### 2021: Mahinga Innovation Centre: Ngawha Innovation and Enterprise Precinct, Northland
[See Portfolio Item 4.0: Office Superstructure & Foundation Design](/Office-Superstructure-&-Foundation-Design.html)<br><br>
Project: Structural design and documentation of single-storey building, including structural steelwork, specific design timber elements and shallow concrete foundations. Elongated S-shaped building footprint.<br><br>

Role: Foundation and Superstructure design and modelling, under guidance of senior engineer.<br>
Superstructure
* SAP2000 structural model
* Steel portal frames
* Tension bracing in roof and walls
* Complex detailing around roof apex
* CFS purlin roof
