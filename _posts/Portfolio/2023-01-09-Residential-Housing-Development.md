Project: New build. Concurrent development projects totalling 40 single and two-storey residential units.
Original design fee apx $100k.
Geotechnical and structural engineering design services.
Government initiative KiwiBuild, aimed to deliver affordable homes.

Role: Project Management, Design Coordination and Construction Monitoring

Project Management
* Tender preparation: Initial scoping and pricing
* Client negotiation and liaison
 * Negotiation of variations totalling apx 50% of original design budget
* Design meetings and liaison with external design parties

Design Coordination
* Coordination of Geotechnical reporting and assessment
 * Earthworks plans, cut/fill
* Coordination of Structural and Foundation Design
 * Existing "standard" building templates existed however these templates were limiting, and majority structures had design changes that required structural verification.
 * Repetitive work: created efficiencies through standardisation of design spreadsheets, and standard details
  * Design of internal timber framing elements outside NZS3604, including:
   * Floor and roof beams, lintels, stairs, 
  * Ribraft foundations for poor soil conditions
   * Bridging piles (for civil services)
  * Timber and concrete retaining walls up to 3.0m high

### 2.1 Context
New build. Concurrent development projects totalling 40 single and two-storey residential units.<br>
Government initiative KiwiBuild, aimed to deliver affordable homes.<br>
Political disaster, primarily due to delays, such as:
* Land procurement
* Resource shortages
* Finance and funding issues
* Design challenges
* Bureaucratic regulatory issues;
Some of these issues we witnessed first-hand.

Prior established relationship with Kainga Ora (NZ homes and communities).<br>
Won two simultaneous KiwiBuild tenders totalling 40 residential units.<br>
Geotechnical, civil and structural engineering design.<br>

### 2.2 Deliverables and Efficiencies
* Deliverable: Standalone design package for each unit
* Strict, staggered timeframes
* Tight budgets
  * Scalability factor
  * Need to create efficiencies in repetition

Before structural design, I brainstormed how we could create efficiencies.
* Took previous project and standardised it
  * Same formula for structural design, drafting and documentation
  * Variation from formula went through me
* Standard, simple-to-use design spreadsheets
  * Timber floor beams and lintels simple to design, standardised timber spreadsheet covering all design elements to minimise likelihood of confusion
  * Complex-to-use design spreadsheet for foundation design was taught to two engineers using them
* Standard details pulled together or created beforehand, for any foreseeable details
* First project we properly used MS Wordâ€™s autopopulate function for quick documentation

### 2.3 Negotiations and Variations
Variations required bespoke design and drafting, introducing rather substantial cost, particularly compared to our original pricing based on repetitive work.

More notable variations include 
* Sloping ground
  * Complex earthworks, cut/fill
  * Additional geotechnical testing and analyses for a suitable sub-base
  * Foundation walls and bridging piles
  * Retaining walls
  * Support for concrete patios
* Redesign for some stairwells
* Redesign of some floor beams
* Drafting for above elements

Negotiated three variations across the duration of the project.<br>
Design budget extended approximately 50%.<br>
Completed design within budget.<br>
