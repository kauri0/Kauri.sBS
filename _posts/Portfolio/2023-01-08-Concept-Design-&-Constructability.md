### 3.1 Context
Consultation for development of basement structure beneath existing 1960â€™s residential building.<br>
Primary contact for all parties and effective project manager.<br>
Existing concept design for basic concrete basement walls.<br>

Project site on mountainside - extreme slopes. Soil excavation undermines the building and adjacent properties. Constructability was the main challenge; concept design revolved almost completely around constructability. Investigation into potential foundation systems, construction methodologies, consultation with piling contractors.

### 3.2 Concept Design & Constructability

* Slope stability analyses
* Scala, borehole and CPT testing across site
* Methodology:
  * Demolish front portion of structure, allowing plant access to building
  * Install secant walls within existing structure
    * Retains soil behind existing building and adjacent properties
    * ECI with piling specialist.
    * Utilise small piling rig to fit within building
  * Demolish existing flooring and install steel beams
    * Acting as both temporary propping, and permanent replacement for existing timber piles supporting structure above
  * Finally possible to excavate soil beneath building
  * Further constructability challenges regarding installation of drainage
    * Utilise weepholes and internal drainage system
    * Shotcrete to form basement walls
* Concept drawings done on Bluebeam
* Project put on hold due to financing issues after early contractor involvement. Construction was deemed too expensive. Expected to resume design in 2023.
