In school, I excelled in mathematics, physics, and so studying engineering seemed like the natural pathway for me. Following university, I have continually sought to develop a deeper understanding of engineering. I have gained a deep appreciation for, and understanding of the materials we work with, of the mathematics that underpin our formulae, of the procedures and regulations that guide (and limit) our possibilities. As a student I worked part time, designing beams for your household renovation, or for earthquake strengthenings, or the pipes under your driveway. Progressing through my career, with now 6 years experience, I managed large-scale housing developments, and designed industrial and commercial buildings - even a museum, across New Zealand. Most recently I designed the UKâ€™s largest timber building, which today is under construction, in the heart of London.

I recently made the switch into finance as a corporate treasury analyst.
