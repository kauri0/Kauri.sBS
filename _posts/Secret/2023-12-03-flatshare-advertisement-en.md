My name's Kauri Beckmann. I left my engineering job in New Zealand one year ago with just my rucksack, for skiing, camping, tramping and all sorts of adventures across Europe. I have been teching myself German for some months, reaching ~B1, and improving more every day. I spent three months hitchhiking around Bavaria, and for a number of reasons, decided Munich will be the stage for the next phase of my life. For the beer, for the culture, the people, and not least of all my beautiful German girlfriend.

Hitchhiking has been a huge part of my travels. In fact, it's been one of the most impactful methods for teaching myself German! It's really a unique way to travel, but it takes some real mental fortitude to stand there smiling, waving at cars passing by. I know it's not so common here in Germany, so when somebody picks me up, I almost feel a responsibility to leave them with a beautiful experience that they can carry with them into the future. It's great, because you get this transient experience with a stranger from a completely different walk of life. I don't have to hitchhike; I have the 49€ ticket. I do it because I get satisfaction out of making people smile.

I have job in a fancy hotel beginning in January. Money will not be a problem; I can also provide bank statements as evidence.

People I have stayed with have written about me...
"not only is he super easy going with an open attitude, it’s also nice to experience this usualy hippyish character mixed with an settled and forward oriented way of living"
"that kind of guy which you meet for the first time and you feel like you have been friends for ever... easy going, interested in German culture and language, clean and helpful."

My former flatmates will also testify that I am...
tidy and organised 
laid-back but proactive 
calm and diplomatic 
active and adventurous (weekend out in the Alps, anyone?) 
that I cook big, healthy meals often, and clean my dishes while cooking!
