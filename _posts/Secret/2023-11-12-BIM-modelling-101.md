##### BIM Notes

**Write an email to Mr Fischnaller, send monday morning.**

Hello Mr Fischnaller,

How are you? I have been reading more about the BIM work you do and have a few questions regarding it.

I better understand now why starting with a focus BIM modelling (as opposed to modelling analyses) is a wise approach, that restructuring workflows is an essential part of BIM design. The shift towards BIM brings about a fundamental change in the way we approach structural design, emphasizing collaboration, data integration, and a comprehensive understanding of the project from the outset.

BIM modelling isn't so different from modelling in Revit, right? Different from what we normally deliver, in terms of the information deliverable. Through formatting the CAD file as per the BIM Execution Plan and performing the specified data exchanges, you create the Common Data Environment. It's kind-of just structural drafting in Revit, except doing it "properly" with BIM compatibility and reciprocal data from the Common Data Environment?

I read that "The structural engineer has the opportunity to expand their role to encompass that of the Employer’s Information Manager as they exhibit many of the core skills and competencies required." I was wondering, what is AJG's typical role in managing data integration? I imagine this varies across different projects, different Levels of Detail, different nD modelling philosophies?

Anyway, I had a bunch more questions, but I'll leave my excitement at that. Looking forward to hearing back!

Cheers,
Kauri Beckmann

**BIM Notes**



I had an adventurous cycle over to Vlore city, and now I'm hiding from the rainstorms in a guest house with my friends. But I haven't just been twiddling my thumbs!

I was curious, somehow I had the feeling that in AJG's projects, AJG is sometimes also the 'Employer’s Information Manager' within projects of certain scope?

On that note, how should I become familiar with BS EN ISO 196502 series of standards?

n that by a focussing on coordinating the formatting of the cad files, by preparing and 
**formatting*, by preparing and integrating the right type of data.



This is not a radical change from what structural engineers currently deliver. What is new is the rigorous and unambiguous scope and the structure of the information deliverable.

the deliverable should be in a consistent digital format that is ready to be federated with other models, as specified in the BIM Execution Plan
* BIM Execution Plan (BEP)
 * Controlled data exchange what information, what format and how often?
 * Common Data Environment (CDE)
 The necessary data exchanges-

Across different projects, I take it you work across 

Though, I find myself generating more questions than answers, and I'm furthermore curious about what the role with entail.
Project requirements
Internal and external coordination and integration
Data integration and management




, studying  BIM modelling 101 and related structural topics in more depth.

Help: Career transition: Structural BIM Modelling

Hi,
I am basically looking for a crash-course in Structural BIM Modelling.
I am guessing I should start by learning Revit and its structural modelling functions and how they tie in with BIM? Where can I find such resources?
(I do indeed understand BIM not just about the model, but also information flow, collaborative capability.)
Cheers

##### BIM Modelling

It’s a rather complex concept that leaves people with a lot of questions. What is BIM? What can BIM do? How does BIM work? Each question has multiple answers

BIM might seem like a brand-new and scary thing for dedicated CAD users—but the shift from CAD to BIM has been a long time coming.

At its core, BIM is 3D design and modelling software with a twist.

**Information. bIm**
Revit, AutoCAD Civil 3D
BIM is an intelligent model-based process
Having high levels of data in a model keeps everyone on the project team on the same page

**3D virtual building modelling. BiM**

..." as well as a process of managing and collecting building data,” according to Moscarello. “When it comes to BIM, everything starts with a 3D digital model of the building.”

**Control and collaboration**

A complete flow of information among applications across distributed project teams for greater accuracy across the entire supply chain.

BIM is fundamentally about sharing structured information and as such is optimally deployed within a collaborative framework.

**Building**
In order to get the true gist of BIM, however, it helps to think of the word “building” in terms of the verb “to build.”

**How?**

It’s perfectly possible to create a 3D CAD model with BIM software by leaving out the metadata and collaboration practices, but you cannot create a proper BIM model without 3D CAD software.

The easiest way to do this is with one type of software that everyone uses to access the same project. You must be able to federate or combine all of these layers of information for various building systems into a single “master” model.

Restructuring workflows is an essential part of BIM.

It creates numerous layers of metadata and renders them within a collaborative workflow.

It’s more about exchanging information and working through the solution rather than passing information along, which is what we’ve done in the past. The model of the way we interact is very different.

The significant disciplines such as architectural, structural and MEP designs should be well-coordinated, as two things can't take place at the same place and time. BIM additionally is able to aid in collision detection, identifying the exact location of discrepancies. 

BIM on existing buildings:
Trying to model a building constructed in, say 1927, requires numerous assumptions about design standards, building codes, construction methods, materials, etc., and is, therefore, more complex than building a model during design. 

nD modelling philosophy
* 3D = 3 spatial dimensions
* 4D = Time. Attributes are added to allow construction
sequencing etc
* 5D = Cost. Attributes are added to allow cost
* 6D = Facilities management (FM). Attributes are added
to allow asset/facilities management; OR:
* 6D = Sustainability
* 7D = Both

Stages of BIM
* Stage 0: Undefined
* Stage 1: Partially structured unfederated data. 
* Stage 2: Structured federated information models.
 * isolated BIM models
 * federation: sharing and coordinating information to Common Data Environment (CDE) 
  * BS EN ISO 196502 series of standards
* Stage 3 (future): Server based object information models
 * queryable database CDE's


BIM Stage 2
Deliverable: Documentation
the deliverable should be in a consistent digital format that is ready to be federated with other models, as specified in the BIM Execution Plan

Deliverable: 3D model
eg. Revit

Deliverable: Non-graphical data


How: Data standards
How: Defined processes. The two most important
documents are:
* Exchange Information Requirements (EIR)
* BIM Execution Plan (BEP)
 * Controlled data exchange what information, what
format and how often?
 * Common Data Environment (CDE)

This is not a radical change from what structural engineers currently deliver. What is new is the rigorous and unambiguous scope and the structure of the information deliverable.

Employ 'Employer’s Information Manager'
To carry out the tasks required for successful BIM implementation. The Construction Industry Council (CIC).
Manage information flow
Who is best? Arch, struct or contractor?

* The structural engineer has the opportunity to expand their role to encompass that of the Employer’s Information Manager as they exhibit many of the core skills and competencies required.


Stages of Exchange
* Work in Progress (WIP): this is a private area where project team members evolve the design within their own discipline.

* Shared: 
The information that project team members need to share with each other to complete their tasks.
 * BIM Execution Plan (BEP)
 * format, data exchanges
  * software versions
  * not necessarily all the same software
   * check that information required by others from them can flow unimpeded.
   * It is entirely possible for project team members to all be using the same software and version, but each in a different way leading to the same incompatibility issues as if they all were using different software.
   *  about how users’ structure and share the information

* Published:
Reached upon agreement among the project team to have reached a significant project milestone 

* Archive
As the project moves to the next milestone a copy of the federated information model is archived
QA, audit and project control.
neutral formats should be required at the ‘Published’ stage and checked for adequacy
Must check the IFC


Structural responsibility
What is the extent of the structural engineer’s design responsibilities? Which systems is the structural engineer responsible for and to what stage of refinement?
What is the extent of the structural engineer’s management and integration responsibilities?

Typical project Construction:
Generally specialist contractors or other engineers
Responsibilities for permanent and temporary works?
Detailing fabrication, manufacture, installation for all components?
Proprietary equipment and components?
