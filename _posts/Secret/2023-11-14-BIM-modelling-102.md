**What is BIM?**

BIM in some ways starts with the 3D model of, say, a building.
While any building can have a 3D model of it created during design; the existence of the 3D model does not qualify it as BIM.
But for a BIM process to occur, a 3D model must be created.
Through integrated design between architectural, structural and mechanical engineers, construction managers, and other relevant services; a centralized platform, a Common Data Environment can be created, reflecting, and accurate to the level of detail required, a n-dimensional model of the building.


What this model truly allows for, is this seamless flow of information, between all parties, at all stages during and after design. This model allows access to accurate, compatible data, allowing informed decisions to be made not just during design by those parties, but also future parties as well - for example, allowing cost and manufacture of bespoke structural elements to high degrees of accuracy; or allowing for, say, a leaky valve in the physical building to be easily idenfied and replaced to spec.

And one more thing, the word "building" comes from it's historical roots in architectural and structural building design. But it's better to think of as stemming from the verb "to build" - it's applicability spans much wider - roads, bridges, process plants; and can be utilized at all stages throughout; during design, construction, and life-span through demolition.





What is BIM?

* In some ways, Starts with 3D model
  * 3D Model does not qualify as BIM
  * BIM requires 3D Model
* Integrated design
 * Centralized Platform: Common Data Environment
  * Reflecting an n-dimensional model
  * Accurate to Level of detail

* Seamless flow of information
 * All parties, informed decisions, all stages

* Inspired by branches
 * Sectors have separate lines of development
 * Master merge
 * Individual teams and team members within.
 * Structure and share information in consistent, compatible manner

* The word "building"
* "To build"
  * Roads, bridges, process plants
  * During design, construction, life-span, demolition

**What are the n-dimensions?** you can elaborate!
But the 3D model alone is only the third dimension.
The fourth dimension allows for the passage of time, for example, designing with construction sequencing and methodologies in mind.
The fifth dimension refers to the integration of cost, primarily for decision-making and facilitating project management capabilities.
The sixth dimenions - either facilities management, or sustainability.
And the seventh dimension, both.

**Branches**
I get the impression BIM modelling is, in some ways, a methodology of implementing, as you would call it in software development, "branches".

Each sector has their separate line of development, together merging into the Common Data Environment. And ideally, each sector has their own Work in Progress, with separate lines of development flowing from the team members within. Users all structure and share the information in a consistent, compatible manner.

**Parametric Design**

parametric design notes

"A design method in which features, such as building elements and engineering components, are shaped based on algorithmic processes rather than direct manipulation." Wikipedia

**??**

If I understand correctly, through proper BIM integration, in theory a client from the BIM model, extract the structural analyses metadata, open SoFiStIk and view and modify these structural analyses on their own hardware?

**Construction**
Can't overlook the impact on construction.
Integration with the construction industry 

**Next**
information among applications across distributed project teams for greater accuracy across the entire supply chain.

This is not a radical change from what structural engineers currently deliver. What is new is the rigorous and unambiguous scope and the structure of the information deliverable.
