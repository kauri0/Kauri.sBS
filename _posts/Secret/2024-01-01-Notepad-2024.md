Jade's flat: Ideas

* Look out for cheap home goods including TOOLS
* Sliding doors to create living bedroom
* Toilet installation - switchboard relocation required?? Alternative??
* Under stairs - probably best for shoes, build shoe rack. How to maximise accessible space behind?
* Knocking down wall is not happening

* Excel spreadsheet for tracking incomings and outgoings
 * Look up key reporting metrics
 * What does it need to do: 

  * Income cash flow:
   * Rental income
    * Tenancies: names, monthly agreements
   * Alternative income streams, eg Airbnb
   * 

  * Expense cash flow:
   * Mortgage interest
   * Maintenance & repairs
    * Needs its own section of expenses where 
   * Insurance

   * Household expenses to be kept separately!

  * Investment performance - tie in existing spreadsheet
   * Renovation costs

Tell me about yourself

About Barratt Homes:
17,206 new homes last year - fantastic performance despite the wild times, growing revenue

Investors -> Financial performance -> Land approval plots
* 2019, 2021 and 2022 ~ 18,500 Land approval plots per annum
* 2020 was a bad year
* 2023 has had... negative 812 Land approval plots?
 * Am I missing something? What's happening this year? This is a mistake, right?

Barratt is focussed primarily on single residential units comprising 1-4 bedrooms, looking at some of the showcases appears to be primarily low-density housing. Urban sprawl and suburbanisation are closely linked with car ownership, public transport and walkability, issues. Which is why UK's wider building planning strategy favours a more compact, high-density, and mixed-use urban form.

New Zealand's property market seems reasonably similar to the UK's. I see many similar policies; First home buyers subsidies, Social housing developments, new build subsidies, big promises to deliver new houses. Likewise our markets trend similarly. 

I understand the UK has recently stopped subsidising purchase of new build houses. Similar to New Zealand, in fact. 

Would it be fair to call this low or medium density housing?

Questions:
What is Barratt Homes doing in terms of creating efficiencies?
* Minimising design costs: no design required is ideal
 * I'm familiar with having "template" building layouts that are selected based on the site
  * Of course, NZ is rather mountaineous, so challenges around flat ground
  * Foundations often need SED
  * Alterations to the superstructure layout require design amendments and add unnecessary cost and complexity
How does Barratt manage their designs; what systems do you use to maximise time and material efficiency?
What is Barratt doing in terms of Building Information Modelling?



Property development in New Zealand

Government initiative KiwiBuild, aimed to deliver affordable homes.
Political and practical disaster, primarily due to delays, such as:

    Land procurement
    Resource shortages
    Finance and funding issues
    Design challenges
    Bureaucratic regulatory issues; Some of these issues we witnessed first-hand.

However in recent years it has picked up rapidly
Good engineering work for our company

Now Kiwibuild is seconding in-house designers - architects, engineers, etc. In a different world I might have joined them.


We worked often on these projects
For me it was from a structural engineering design perspective
    I also oversaw and managed the civil and geotechnical design
    And I had close exposure to the architectural design
