##### What are you looking for?
##### Why Foster & Partners?

Continue to develop technical and soft skills
Towards chartership

Exposure to Building Information Modelling
This is the future of Engineering, and the direction I want to move in
F+P excels at

I want to be able to go home and be proud of the projects I work on
When the public sees the building I want to be able to say I worked on it

In NZ I was always proud when I could point out the buildings I'm working on
And I knew that I'd been involved in the design or coordination of the project.
But the scale, here in London it's different.

Norman Foster is iconic, Speaks to London city. 
Going down in history, an influence on modern global architecture
The Bloomberg building, Sister works there, been inside 
The Gherkin, 
The Harry Potter bridge 
What more?

F&P has a wild list of major projects
I plan on being here for the foreseeable future, so I can 

##### When are you ready to start
Pretty much immediately. What are they looking for? What's the flexibility there?


Have you got which skills:
Are you chartered?


Could you tell me more about the specific job? 
It wasn't clear in the job description, what sorts of projects this role is for?


Growing, expanding, replacing someone?

Size of the team
What else do I need to know about them

I'm trying to get an understanding of the salaries. What should I be expecting in terms of pay?

What's the process?
What are the next steps?
In-person for interviews?

Vague
It's not clear what sorts of projects.
What sort of projects will I be on?
What kind of interview is this going to be?


* Tell me a bit about yourself


* What sort of role are you looking for?


### BIM
I have a strong desire to develop into BIM, as this is the future of Engineering. The shift towards BIM brings about a fundamental change in the way we approach structural design, emphasizing collaboration, data integration, and a comprehensive understanding of the project from the outset. I'm applying for this role because of AECOM's excellent track record in delivering BIM projects. I'm confident my background in Structural Engineering gives me the skills to easily transition into a structural technician role.

I better understand now why starting with a focus BIM modelling (as opposed to modelling analyses) is a wise approach, that restructuring workflows is an essential part of BIM design. The shift towards BIM brings about a fundamental change in the way we approach structural design, emphasizing collaboration, data integration, and a comprehensive understanding of the project from the outset.

BIM modelling isn't so different from modelling in Revit, right? Different from what we normally deliver, in terms of the information deliverable. Through formatting the CAD file as per the BIM Execution Plan and performing the specified data exchanges, you create the Common Data Environment. It's kind-of just structural drafting in Revit, except doing it "properly" with BIM compatibility and reciprocal data from the Common Data Environment?

crash-course in Structural BIM Modelling.

### Required skills

Calculations, analysis, drawings, diagrams, models

Co-ordination of the internal design team
Responsibility, where required by the project leader, for specific areas of the design and project development 

    Able to demonstrate initiative and a proactive approach to daily tasks
    Good interpersonal skills and able to work independently and as part of an effective team 
    Flexible attitude 

    An undergraduate degree of at least 4 years duration and a postgraduate degree at the MSc level or above in structural engineering
    Understanding of all aspects of the role of an engineer in particular all relevant and current legislation
    Ability to use initiative in response to demands of project
    Proven skills in all aspects of negotiation and communication (whether graphical, written or verbal) including ability to listen and to understand others
    Ability to understand and formulate design decisions
    Ability to co-ordinate and integrate the work of internal and external members of the design team
    Understanding of financial aspects of running a design project on time and on budget
    Ability to manage and motivate a team, to organise oneself and others
    Ability and effectively manage large amounts of project related information and data
    Understanding of the importance of common standards for the structure of project related digital data
    Ability to manage relationship with client efficiently, effectively, and professionally
    Ability to use some of the following: GSA, ETABS, SAFE, MicroStation, InDesign, Internet Explorer, Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint





Earthquake design:

Simple approach: 
Based on fault proximity and soil conditions etc
As well as weight of building
NZ: Assume some ductility level, base shear varies
Determine base shear
Distribute across building height

V* = k * d
base shear = stiffness x displacement??

Does not account for dynamic and inelastic response

Elastic design -> no yield assumed/allowed 
Inelastic / plastic design -> determine yield mechanism at ULS

Jade's flat: Ideas

* Look out for cheap home goods including TOOLS
* Sliding doors to create living bedroom
* Toilet installation - switchboard relocation required?? Alternative??
* Under stairs - probably best for shoes, build shoe rack. How to maximise accessible space behind?
* Knocking down wall is not happening

* Excel spreadsheet for tracking incomings and outgoings
 * Look up key reporting metrics
 * What does it need to do: 

  * Income cash flow:
   * Rental income
    * Tenancies: names, monthly agreements
   * Alternative income streams, eg Airbnb
   * 

  * Expense cash flow:
   * Mortgage interest
   * Maintenance & repairs
    * Needs its own section of expenses where 
   * Insurance
   * Service charges etc
   * Property taxes
   * Depreciation??
   * Household expenses to be kept separately!

  * Investment performance - tie in existing spreadsheet

Tell me about yourself

About Barratt Homes:
17,206 new homes last year - fantastic performance despite the wild times, growing revenue

Investors -> Financial performance -> Land approval plots
* 2019, 2021 and 2022 ~ 18,500 Land approval plots per annum
* 2020 was a bad year
* 2023 has had... negative 812 Land approval plots?
 * Am I missing something? What's happening this year? This is a mistake, right?

Barratt is focussed primarily on single residential units comprising 1-4 bedrooms, looking at some of the showcases appears to be primarily low-density housing. Urban sprawl and suburbanisation are closely linked with car ownership, public transport and walkability, issues. Which is why UK's wider building planning strategy favours a more compact, high-density, and mixed-use urban form.

New Zealand's property market seems reasonably similar to the UK's. I see many similar policies; First home buyers subsidies, Social housing developments, new build subsidies, big promises to deliver new houses. Likewise our markets trend similarly. 

I understand the UK has recently stopped subsidising purchase of new build houses. Similar to New Zealand, in fact. 

Would it be fair to call this low or medium density housing?

 * 2023 has had... negative 812 Land approval plots? why...?
* menu bug

Questions:
What is Barratt Homes doing in terms of creating efficiencies?
* Minimising design costs: no design required is ideal
 * I'm familiar with having "template" building layouts that are selected based on the site
  * Of course, NZ is rather mountaineous, so challenges around flat ground
  * Foundations often need SED
  * Alterations to the superstructure layout require design amendments and add unnecessary cost and complexity
How does Barratt manage their designs; what systems do you use to maximise time and material efficiency?
What is Barratt doing in terms of Building Information Modelling?



Property development in New Zealand

Government initiative KiwiBuild, aimed to deliver affordable homes.
Political and practical disaster, primarily due to delays, such as:

    Land procurement
    Resource shortages
    Finance and funding issues
    Design challenges
    Bureaucratic regulatory issues; Some of these issues we witnessed first-hand.

However in recent years it has picked up rapidly
Good engineering work for our company

Now Kiwibuild is seconding in-house designers - architects, engineers, etc. In a different world I might have joined them.


We worked often on these projects
For me it was from a structural engineering design perspective
    I also oversaw and managed the civil and geotechnical design
    And I had close exposure to the architectural design
