##### Thursday 28th September

Sometimes I feel blue, then I think of you,<br>
But sometimes my heart only aches;<br>
I think back to days we'd only just met,<br>
The trenches we did not foresake.

I have not forgetten the way that you scold,<br>
Nor have I the way that you tease,<br>
Today I cover my mouth when I burp;<br>
Amendments for love, I appease.

I think of you in your cute yellow dress,<br>
An angel, a golden-day glow,<br>
I picture your smile, your damn-sexy aura,<br>
I feel myself aching below.

I crave it, the touch of your strong slender body,<br>
Your body, the way that it curls;<br>
I dream of our bed, the littlest spoon,<br>
Your warmth, shielding a grey world.

'Cause inside a darkness, a fear of myself,<br>
A fear of the trenches too deep;<br>
I envy the others; it all seems so simple:<br>
The lies, the secrets we keep.

When I think of you, I do feel alive,<br>
I feel your love colourful cures;<br>
Hold you in my arms and never let go,<br>
And when you return I'll be yours.

Love,<br>
Kauri
