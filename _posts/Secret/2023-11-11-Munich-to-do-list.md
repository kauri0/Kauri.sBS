##### Saturday 11th November 2023

##### Before Munich:


* Secure your job, ASAP
  * Look at travel agencies in Munich for roles
* Find accommodation in Munich
  * Offered through a hotel?
* ~~Sort out your finances~~
  * ~~Talk to mum again, she's gonna be mad but spin it well~~
  * ~~$400 NZD per week incoming, valid until February.~~
* Short story about upcoming Christmas-New Year's plans
 * Update story: How Christmas-New Year's went!
  * Three of my close friends around the middle of Europe

* Keep studying German
* ~~Start studying FEM modelling! Find some material to consume~~
* ~~FIX YOUR HAMMOCK! Take it in to Vl√∂re right now?~~
* 


Confirm return dates to Germany. Based on job, most likely.
Have a job to return to. Email some more hotels soon.
Find a place to live! You should really send some messages and try and get a contract sorted.
Talk to mum. You need to sort out your finances. Show her your stock portfolio, you don't want to dip into it. (I wonder if there's going to be more financial crashes, to be fair. But most of your money is safe in a portfolio anyway. When's the next time for growth?)
Study about FEM modelling processes. What does that look like day-to-day?

Stop wasting so much time on your phone and your laptop, man. Start doing some of these things right now. After you watch an episode of twin peaks, at least.

Apply for a bunch more hotel jobs!

##### In Munich:
Book dates in the city with Lucie
Find a bjj gym!
* Wash your gear - especially your sleeping bag!
 * Hang your stuff out to dry
 * ~~FIX YOUR HAMMOCK!~~
* Cybersecurity: start investing into bitcoin.
   * No need for foreign investments, right? You have NZ and USA already.

* Write the long story about your hammock
