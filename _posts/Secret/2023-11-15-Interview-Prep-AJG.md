##### Question: Strengths and Weaknesses


Weakness: Uncertainty, Lack of confidence
I’m sure you’ve also had projects where you’re nervous, praying the construction goes to plan, that a scaffolding doesn’t blow away, or that the foundation doesn’t sink.
Re technical skills
Not always sure my calculations have some error
Or I’m following the right approach
Spend a lot of time reviewing details and drawings
A lot of time searching for better ways to do something
Different modelling approach
More detailed analysis
Important having the right resources and people
Whether that’s for confirmation or providing guidance
Of course there’s more room to grow, but that uncertainty, impostor syndrome,
I wonder, how does that change with your experience?

Weakness: Effecting change
H&S always had a lot of ideas and ways to do things
Overhauled system in first year
The rest of the years trying to get people to do the digital paperwork correctly
Reward and punishment
Developing new systems and policies - slow
Implementing them - even slower
Covid set that apart


##### Strength: Problem solving
I know cycle touring is reasonably popular in Germany, have you ever been before?
You’ve probably noticed, typically you’ve got saddlebags, front and back, reasonably low centre of gravity, reasonably even distribution of weight.
I’ve been cycle touring the last few weeks, 50€ bicycle, 25 kilo tramping rucksack. I was explaining to my partner about some challenges I was having during this cycle tour, how I was struggling to strap my rucksack on my bicycle, unstable, unbalanced, how after two weeks the most stable solution is to wear it.
Of course she laughed at me, reminding me, the engineer, she’s never known not to have a solution.
While I’ve been in town I took the time to build a contraption on the back of my bike to keep the rucksack stable, and a counterweight system on the front, and it’s holding on the bumpy paving stones in this city.
I think my strength is my problem-solving ability, but also creativity and enjoyment of a challenge.
And I think that reflects in my engineering, given design challenges, engineering constraints, I’m always looking for a better solution.

Identified wasting time with their booking system
Optimizing prices
Automating system 
Went a step further of downloading the software and running a trial
So in this situation I took the initiative, identify an issue and propose an implementable solution.
 
##### Question: Tell us about BIM
My extent of experience with BIM is limited to reviewing 3D Revit models created by my draftspeople.
Design conflicts; 3D reinforcement
Structural detailing direct from 3D model

I understand there’s a lot more to it.

Always wondered about the possibilities of BIM, and I can see it has the potential to solve many of the same problems I’ve faced in my own projects.
Integration with 3D structural models
Parametric design
Interdisciplinary coordination
Architects and other engineers
Sustainability calculations
Cost and time savings for complex projects
Variable Level of Detail

I know there’s some criticisms around BIM, but I think these are challenges to be overcome.
High learning curve -> mistakes
Interdisciplinary inoperability, current lack of standardised processes
Maintenance during project life cycle
High cost, limited applications in smaller projects due to high complexity


In my role in New Zealand, structural drafting and structural design have been somewhat separate specialities.
 this was always a source of complexity in design - coordinating information
Before learning about BIM I assumed this was the norm.

Please tell me if I understood incorrectly, but at AJG it’s different. The line between design and drafting seems a lot more blurred. Could you tell me a little more about that? How that impacts the work you do?
How does that shape the way you do engineering?


##### Question: Why AJG

 Why AJG
I want to be able to go home and be proud of the projects I work on
When the public sees the building I want to be able to say I worked on it
Proud for the rest of my life
Why Munich
Looking at companies in Munich
Love the city, Close relationships with people here
I decided I’m going to build the next chapter of my life here

Looking at companies in Munich (again)
Your company stood out
Exemplary engineering work
The complex nature of your projects
Gorgeous designs to be proud of
Gärtnerplatztheater                (Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz)
Therme Erding
Recycling plants look like quality engineering
I think it’s incredible you played a part in this project,
I’d love to work on such meaning projects
A focus on BIM, the future of engineering
Fast learner, important for me as an engineer to work in a firm that does it this way

Looking for a place I like the colleagues 
Smaller, family business, previously worked in similar size
Work close with colleagues, be friends with them, enjoyed going to work
Fast growth, a lot of opportunity to work closely with the team, sit with them and learn and share with them.
Looking for a good office culture
Contribute my knowledge and learn from others

It’s important for me to know how I’ll fit with your team. What is it like, the culture at AJG? How do you find it going to work each day?

##### Question: Language?
Studying some months
Proud of the progress I’ve made so far    (Fortschritt)
People around to support
Eurocodes, German DIN
Design, modelling English
German Eng Drawings terminology, almost as quickly as I’ll learn how to complain about the DeutscheBahn
Tools like DeepL, not long term sustainable solution
Clients, architects, contractors; notoriously traditional industry
AJG stands out

Question for you, how would my language capabilities fit in with your team?


##### Questions for AJG
What does project management look like in terms of timeframes, how many engineerings working together, what does the project management structure look like in general?
Primary design software
SoFiSTiK FEM
Revit
I’ve told you about the softwares I’ve had exposure to,
I read you’re using these softwares,
I imagine there will be some new systems for me
What sorts of programs are you using on a day-to-day basis
What sort of training are you expecting I’ll undertake?

You’ve been doing engineering here a long time, I’m, curious, why AJG? about what stands out about this company to you?

What are your favourite projects you’ve worked on?

Who is the kind of person that would be successful in this role?
Who are you looking for? What are the qualities of someone that would do well?

##### Question throughout around BIM and how it impacts their design

It’s important for me to know how I’ll fit with your team. What is it like, the culture at AJG? How do you find it going to work each day?

##### Question for you, how would my language capabilities fit in with your team?

It was so nice to chat to you, I’m wondering what the next steps are going to be. When will I hear back?



I’m travelling and applying for jobs now and looking to line something in the new year.
But when are you expecting the role to begin.
But I really like your firm and I can be flexible if it’s needed.


##### Challenges
A good challenge was a very budget oriented client we had.
Initially priced based on repetitive work
Scope of work having to change, no way around it, large variations
Extremely unhappy, unapproachable changing scope and budget, teammates unwilling to discuss
Don't shy away from conflict
Address with clear communication
Sent email, phone call
Initially not happy at all about it
Explain why budget had to change
Needed exact reason for every single change
Later email, answered all questions
Appreciate my approach
Change his mind
Learn valuable negotiation skills
Improved relationship going forward
Complete within timeframe and budget

Through solid relationship we won future work with this client
I believe Cook Costello still has a good working relationship
