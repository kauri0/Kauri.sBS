<p>Dear Georg,</p>

<p><br />
I’ve been reflecting on our conversation on Wednesday. The group meeting was really needed – Lucia and I did leave the kitchen in an unacceptable state; unemptied bins, a few dishes forgotten by the sink. It was exactly the wake-up call we needed after an exceptionally busy night.</p>

<p><br />
You are right; we should leave the kitchen spotless at all times, but especially when you are coming back from holiday. Though, I do hope you appreciated coming back to a house stocked with fresh food. Because when you left for holiday last Wednesday, Lucia arrived home to find rancid milk, peppers rotting in the fridge, and the apples, more like compost. Like the rest, you’ll probably never know. It’s just one of those little things.</p>

<p><br />
You are right; as a guest for one week, I should take more care of the little things around the house, to make up for the fact that I drink your coffee and don’t pay rent. Next time I’ll make sure to tell you  when I clean the toilet, when I rehang laundry fallen to the floor, or when I wash the dirty dishes you’ve left on the counter. I’m going to show you the receipt for the milk and oats and fresh vegetables I buy. I’ll keep offering you dinner, even though the last two times you didn’t eat any of it. I sure wouldn’t want to be called a freeloader again!</p>

<p><br />
You are right; in a garage with eight bikes, two cars and a rusty ping-pong table, Lucia’s second bike is incredibly inconvenient; it’s taking up far too much space. Berate her, take it away! Oh, and don’t bother offering any obvious solutions either. And when she takes it to heart and decides to find a solution the same day… “Oh, what are you doing? I didn’t mean for you to do it right now!”</p>

<p><br />
It’s just a little thing, the way you talk to people. Intolerant, unempathetic, callous; yet somehow so emotional. It must be nice being flatmate-landlord. You’re an equal, you’re superior. Whatever’s more convenient? I suggest you don’t move out of mum and dad’s old home – because when you don’t hold all the power, you’re fucked.</p>

<p><br />
I realize I haven’t properly said, thanks for the hospitality. Next time I’ll empty the bins for you too.</p>

<p><br />
Cheers,</p>

<p><br />
Kauri</p>

<p><br />
P.s: Sorry for not telling you my upcoming travel plans until you asked.</p>
