      Asymmetrical Warfare

    <h3 id="part-i">Part I</h3>

<p>I didn’t even bother with my bugnet. The initial wave may have just been the scouts, but my defences were ready. For thirty minutes, the aerial ninjas intimidated and mercilessly drew blood, however their ranks sustained heavy casualties. Those stealthy enough to remain undetected flew home on a full belly, but after hearing of the decimation of their peers, the full ranks decided not to advance. Only the occasional hungry nomadic wanderer stumbled through, with whom I shared an intimate connection, and freely offered sustenance.</p>

<h3 id="part-ii">Part II</h3>

<p>Two unwitting fools sought out the perfect campsite stumble around the foothills of the mountain they’d climb tomorrow. He left to gather some wood, and returned to find her bewildered, surrounded by a living cloud shading the midnight sun. This was their territory. Wherever the fools went, the cloud followed. There was no escape.</p>

<p>Tonight the warriors would not sleep under the stars, nor would they forfeit. They coated their skins with a heavy-duty camoflage. They set up their fortress, the primary defensive structure, where they would take shelter during the night. But the weary warriors needed nourishment, and their fortress sat idly by.</p>

<p>They got to cooking, but the smell of another juicy meal only lured more attackers. Their numbers were overwhelming. In one casual leg-slap, five passed, five more joined. They darted into the most unwelcome of places. One had to take care breathing, lest they find themselves breathing more than air. The pasta, one could no longer call it vegetarian.</p>

<p>Entering the fortress was no easy task. To prepare, they packed their bags, and moved fifty metres from camp to brush their teeth. The cloud followed - the lure worked. They made a mad dash, with her diving headfirst, followed by flying bags, a second pair of lanky legs, a zipper furiously closed, a copious, contagious laughter.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>
