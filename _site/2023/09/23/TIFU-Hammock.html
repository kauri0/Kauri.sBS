<p>Well, technically I fucked up three weeks ago when I put my name on the delivery for a rather special type of fabric. Or maybe I fucked up when I put a little hole in my hammock, or when I thought Decathlon had the solution. In any case, a culmination of little fuck-ups has led me to sleeping on the ground for the next month.</p>

<p>Travelling by hitchhike, you have to be flexible. I don’t always know where I’m going to sleep. Sometimes it’s with friends, sometimes with strangers, but my hammock has been the shining star. Though I usually take time to find a beautiful spot, in a pinch it sets up almost anywhere with two trees. And if there’s no trees, then a power pylon… but that’s another story. It’s quick to set up, warm, more comfortable than my own bed.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>So, you’re an idiot… You put your name on the address for the hammock delivery… What a day…
You check on your hammock material. Precious stuff, from the States. It’s arrived, 3:29pm yesterday. You were there, working on your test.</p>

<p>Nobody knocked, the fucking cunts. Fine. We go pick it up together form the PO box three k’s away. Isn’t that a rather large box, for a little parachute material? But it says United States Postal Service on the box!</p>

<p>We go get coffee nearby, and open it up. Little paper shreds fly everywhere. It’s wrapped in bubble wrap. Rather precious material, I tell ya! Makes sense, for a Surface Keyboard…</p>

<p>The wrong package, they’re both delivered at the exact same time! Fuck… The other package must still be in the PO box, a little thing tucked in the back, right? Nope. After calling, calling, it’s being shipped back to the States. They didn’t see my name on the mailbox. FOR FUCKS SAKE. The name of the day.</p>

<p>Schafberg notes</p>

<p>Finally caved in; taking the train toward Berlin. Took a lot of short rides today. In hindsight, yesterday I should have gone with Wagdi all the way to München. Travelling tired with a headache sucks. No coffee sucks.</p>

<p>I hiked up Schafberg yesterday, at good pace, starting from Obenburgau. Magnificent views from the top! I hiked down the other side to St Wolfgang at reasonable pace too, to catch the shops before they closed. Time crunch to make it back to town, St Wolfgang. There’s an outdoor store there, I’ll top up my gas.</p>

<p>Actually, I do take an hour-long nap on the trail. I hear noisy, obnoxious people draw closer – and decide not to be stuck behind them. At one point I waited for a few moments for some others to catch up, at an intersection between an unpaved road, and a typical forest path. I asked them which was faster to St Wolfgang – more an icebreaker than a genuine question. They switched to English, and he said, in all seriousness, “We are going this way, but considering the shoes you’re wearing, maybe you should go the other way.” HI was, jogging down a gnarly mountain with my giant backpack, and I’m told my shoes are inadequate? Do I look like such a rookie? They only caught up with me because I took a 30 minute nap on a log! Stunned, all I could muster was a lousy “Come on?” I followed them briefly down the forest trail, then pulled a controlled jog-slide down a short, steep bypass, leaving them in the dust. Though, the rest of the walk I only felt embarrassment.</p>

<p>I made it to St Wolfgang before the outdoor store closed. But it didn’t sell gas, what the fuck? So, St Wolfgang’s outdoor stores don’t sell gas. Oh well, I’d eat cold for the meanwhile – better stock up! There’s one supermarket. I’m distracted for a few minutes, studing a giant map of the town. Those few minutes ticked over to 5:01pm, and the supermarket was now closed. For fucks sake.
I went for a swim in the lake, then had a large pizza. Then a few rides, and felt my German rapidly improve. Including with Wagdi, and his silent partner. 28yo, loves München, Pharmaceutical Engineer, plays football and volleyball.</p>

<p>One-way crossing, lake-to-lake. I spent the first night at the foothills, in a cave overlooking a crashing waterfall. In hindsight, deafening. Not such a problem for the sleep quality, but maybe for the eardrums… And I forgot to restock my gas. This was on a Friday, mind you. All shops are closed on Sundays – and the Monday, a public holiday. I cook dinner on an open fire, use the last dregs of gas for my morning coffee and skiddaddle.</p>

<p>Schlafberg – gorgeous, gruelling. Nice to get the legs properly working. Not so many people on the trail, but you get to the top, and there’s everybody and their mum. Literally. A cable car takes you to the restaurant at the top! A skifield in winter, bustling it seems. And for good reason – 360 degree views of the Lakes, the Alps, Austrian towns.</p>

<p>All that to say, the next night I made a little campfire to cook dinner on. One stray ember put a giant hole in the hammock. Oops. I pick up some repair patches from Decathlon, and god to work.
The next week I’m staying in hostels. Berlin, then on to celebrate Sachin’s graduation in Poznan. That’s a whole story on it’s own. A few days later, back on the road! I find a lovely spot by a river beach near Bamberg, and set up shop. I went for a run upstream, then swam back down  Then retired into my hammock – RIIIIP! The hammock tears almost in two. So much for the repair patch. Oops.</p>

<p>I’m waiting for some spare material to arrive from the states to fix it. In the meantime, time to set up bivvy mode!</p>
