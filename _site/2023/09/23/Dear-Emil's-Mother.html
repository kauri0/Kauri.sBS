<p>Dear Emil’s mother,</p>

<p><br />
I just wanted to say a proper thankyou for everything – your kindness has not been lost on me! 
When Emil and his girlfriend Paula asked me if I was hungry – and suggested we detour to a specific kebab shop in Brussels – I did not expect Paula to return with just one giant kebab for me! Somehow I feel you have been a wonderful mother… your kindness is certainly reflected in your son!</p>

<p><br />
I’m sorry about the night prior. I was camped thirty metres into a rather beautiful bush behind a construction site, where Emil and Paula dropped me off. (I was definitely not supposed to be there!) Not recognizing Emil and Paula, but shadowed strangers calling in the distance, I turned my head torch off and hid!</p>

<p><br />
And the breakfast, lunch and constant snacks – you really stuffed all three of us kids! I have never been offered a full change of clothes before after a shower – let alone a brand new vape!
My friends ask me to tell stories – and it seems, for some reason, now they all want to meet you and your family. Though we could not speak directly, I felt your motherly warmth and kindness. I really enjoyed spending the afternoon with you.</p>

<p><br />
What is it about your culture, that makes you so kind to strangers? Along my travels I met many Ukranian people, and they have all been so kind, caring, charitable to me.</p>

<p><br />
I wish all the best for you, your family and your countrymen.</p>

<p><br />
Until I see you again,</p>

<p><br />
Kauri</p>

<p><br />
Ps: I ate all your chocolate in two days.</p>
