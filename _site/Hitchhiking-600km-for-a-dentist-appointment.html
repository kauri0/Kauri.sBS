    <h5 id="foreword">Foreword</h5>

<p>Actually, this one is an English translation. You can read the <a href="/Fahren-600km-mit-Anhalter-für-einen-Zahnarzttermin.html">German Original here</a>.</p>

<h5 id="wednesday-7th-june">Wednesday 7th June</h5>

<p>Three weeks ago I sent an email to a dental practice in Munich. To this dental practice, to eight others too. These practices replied immediately. Rather generic and impersonal response, to a rather specific email. Suspect, for a Friday afternoon….</p>

<p>I put it on the back burner, and waited two weeks. The responses were overwhelming - with a grand tota of… zero responses. So, in the middle of some Polish bush, using the last of all my batteries, I started calling each dental office. No answer, no English, the dentist is on vacation. I book an appointment, 21st June, for a short initial consultation… 21 June!? How long might I have to wait for the actual procedures?</p>

<p>I thought back about Alldent. Immediate answer. I could have a booking just two days in advance. I’ll come to Munich to see Lucia. Oh, I find out, Lucia will not be there. Fuck it! How many people can say they hitchhiked 600km for a dentist appointment?</p>

<p>It was not a simple 600km. Challenges with hitchhiking, a hammock torn in two, an epic battle with the mosquitoes - but these are stories for another time. On to Munich! To make good time, in the morning I took the regional train to the city. Remember, I gave them all the information - a report from my dentist in New Zealand, including Xrays, technical details for the implant buried under my gums, and an explanation of the remaining procedure - Restoration and Crowning. It’s an international standard system.</p>

<p>I arrive early, fill out the paperwork, and sit in the lobby for 30 minutes. They finally call me to the dentist. We talk and, within 30 seconds he tells me, “We can’t crown a third-party implant. It’s a liability issue, a risk we’re not allowed to take.” 30 seconds, 30 euro. Fuck off, why didn’t these wankers just tell me that on the phone!?</p>

<p>So, long story short, I am now in a youth hostel waiting for Lucie. I have to stay in Munich tomorrow for another appointment with another doctor. We talked a lot on the phone, and at least they implied that they could complete the procedures. Wish me luck!</p>

<h5 id="friday-9th-june">Friday 9th June</h5>

<p>Future update: It was good! There is a few details to sort out, but I think I will continue with them.</p>

<h5 id="sunday-25th-september">Sunday 25th September</h5>

<p>The last dentists in Germany wanted three-bloody-thousand euro! After scrutinizing their quotes, I decided to wait. Just ten-thousand kilometres later…</p>

<p>Here in Tirana, Albania I was given a fixed quote at 1/3 of the price. Fast, good communication, excellent quality of work. Within a week of arriving I had my brand new tooth. I’m currently volunteering in a beautiful hostel here in Tirana, with a big new smile - but that’s a story for another time!</p>
