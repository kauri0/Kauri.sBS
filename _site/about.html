<p><br />Dear friends and family, and to those of you I’ve met along the way,
<br />
<br />
As you may or may not know, for the last seven months I’ve been travelling around Europe. I’ve been skiing in Austria and France, exploring the German and Austrian Alps, and searched for secret hot springs in the Pyrenees Mountains.  I’ve attended a graduation ceremony in Poland, [remove volunteered in the most beautiful hostel in Albania], and unofficially co-authored a research paper in Germany. I’ve hitchhiked over 20,000km to date. I’ve fallen in love, I’ve fallen into despair, I’ve contemplated life, battered by howling winds, hanging beneath the legs of a mountaintop power pylon. It’s been a quarter-life crisis of an adventure, and I’d like to share that with you.</p>

<p>I’m ashamed to say, I’m not exactly great at sharing my life. I think about you a lot. (Some of you, more than others.) That’s why I’ve decided to create this blog, to share with you some of my favourite stories from my travels. Some are stories of love and kindness, of the beautiful people I’ve met along the way. Others are of failure and frustration, or chaos and absurdity. Some yet are simply a documentation of the beauty of nature.</p>

<p>So, I hope you enjoy and get a taste of my experiences, a taste of the bullshit adventures I call life.
<br />
<br />Love,
<br />Kauri
<br />
<br />Ps: For those of you wondering, I’ve also decided, fuck the plans to work in the UK. At time of writing I’m volunteering in Tirana, Albania with, shall we say, <em>plans</em>. I’ll update this here when I’m certain what’s coming next.
<br />
<br />Pps: Some stories will have German translations. In fact, some stories are English translations. <em>write in Deutsche</em>
To you Germans, if you want a proper laugh, feel free to check out the originals.</p>
